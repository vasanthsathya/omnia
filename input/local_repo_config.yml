# By default, set to false to enable secure (HTTP) connection to the Pulp server.
# Update to true if required to connect to the Pulp server using HTTPS.
pulp_protocol_https: true

# enable_routed_internet should be set to true for clusters having partial or no dedicated internet access.
# enable_routed_internet should be set to false for clusters having dedicated internet access.
# When set to true, Squid Proxy will be deployed on OIM and will be used for routing requests from compute nodes.
# By default, enable_routed_internet is set to true.

# This variable accepts the repository urls of the user which contains the packages required for the cluster.
# User should make sure required disk space is available.
# This variable accepts repo url, gpgkey and name, sslcacert, sslclientkey, and sslclientcert, policy
# url: defines the baseurl for the repository
# gpgkey: defines gpgkey for the repository
# name: defines name for the repository
# sslcacert, sslclientkey, sslclientcert : Defines respective certificate file paths.
# policy: Add the policy(always, partial, never) depending upon desired configuration.
# If gpgkey is empty then gpgcheck will be disabled for that repository
# This variable should not have jinja variables in it.
# and user leaves the gpgkey field empty (gpgkey: "" ), omnia configures the repository as a trusted source and the user is solely
# responsible in maintaining the security.
# If you are using SSL certificates for encryption, include the sslcacert, sslclientkey, and sslclientcert fields.
# Example:
# - { url: "", gpgkey: "", name: "", sslcacert: "", sslclientkey: "", sslclientcert: "", policy: "" }
# Omit these fields entirely if SSL is not in use.
# Example:
# user_repo_url:
#   - {url: "",gpgkey: "",name: ""}
user_repo_url:

# Optional
# This variable defines a list of user-provided container registries containing images required for the cluster.
# Users must ensure sufficient disk space is available for image storage.
#
# Each registry entry accepts the following fields:
# - host: The registry URL/hostname (e.g., 10.11.0.100/abcd.dev.test).
# - cert_path: Absolute path to the CA certificate file for the registry. If empty, the registry is treated as insecure.
# - key_path: Path to the client key file, if required by the registry.
# - name: A unique identifier for the registry.
# - requires_auth: Set to true if the registry requires authentication with username/password, otherwise false.
#
# Example:
# user_registry:
#   - { host: 10.11.0.100, cert_path: "/home/ca.crt", key_path: "", name: "local", requires_auth: true }
#   - { host: hostname.registry.test, cert_path: "", key_path: "", name: "external", requires_auth: false }
user_registry:

# Mandatory when cluster_os_type is rhel in softwares_config.json
# User has to provide the code ready builder url that should not have a RedHat subscription authentication inorder to download the packages
# and the rhel_os_url configured via proxy in compute nodes
# Example:
# rhel_os_url:
#   - {url: "http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/", gpgkey: "http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/RPM-GPG-KEY", name: "codeready-builder"}

### ADVANCE CONFIGURATIONS FOR LOCAL REPO ###
# Mandatory
# This variable defines all the repo urls from where rpms will be downloaded for omnia features when cluster_os_type is rhel.
# Making incorrect changes to this variable can cause omnia failure. Please edit cautiously.
# 'url' defines the baseurl for the repository
# 'gpgkey' defines gpgkey for the repository
# If 'gpgkey' is kept empty then gpgcheck=0 for that repository
