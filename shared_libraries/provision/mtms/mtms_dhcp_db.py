      Update the database with new node information.

      This function establishes a connection with omniadb and performs the following tasks:
      - Extracts serial and bmc information from the dynamic stanza path.
      - Checks if the serial exists in the cluster.nodeinfo table.
      - If not, it generates a new node name and host name based on the node_name and domain_name.
      - It updates the stanza file with the new serial, node, and dynamic_stanza_path.
      - If reassignment_status is True and correlation_status is True, it reassigns the
    bmc_ip and calculates the admin_ip.
      - If reassignment_status is True and correlation_status is False, it reassigns the
    bmc_ip and calculates the admin_ip.
      - If reassignment_status is False, it calculates the admin_ip.
      - It inserts the node information into the cluster.nodeinfo table.
