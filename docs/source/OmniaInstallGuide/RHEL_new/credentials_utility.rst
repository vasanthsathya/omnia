Step 2: Provide all credentials required during Omnia's execution
===================================================================

Omnia provides an additional utility playbook called ``get_config_credentials.yml``. This playbook upon execution creates an input file called ``omnia_config_credentials.yml`` in the ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default`` folder.
In this input file, you can provide all types of mandatory and optional credentials required by Omnia during its execution.

Prerequisite
---------------

Ensure that the ``omnia_core`` container is up and running.

Task performed by the playbook
---------------------------------

Creates an input file called ``omnia_config_credentials.yml`` in the ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default`` folder.

Execute the playbook
----------------------

To execute the playbook, run the following command: ::

    ssh omnia_core
    cd /omnia/utils/credential_utility
    ansible-playbook get_config_credentials.yml

Things to keep in mind
------------------------

* While executing any Omnia playbook which requires certain credentials, you'll now see a prompt to enter them during playbook execution.
* Credential fields which have the tag ``mandatory`` cannot be left empty. If the ``mandatory`` passwords are not provided or incorrect, the playbook execution will stop and exit while encrypting the credentials file in the background.
* Credential fields which have the tag ``optional`` can be skipped. Even if no input is provided, playbook execution will continue.
* Passwords provided by you will be hidden. You must enter the password for a second time to confirm.
* This utility also supports using tags to provide credentials for specific features or packages. For example, you can use ``--tags provision`` while executing the playbook to only bring up the credentials required to provision the cluster nodes.

Post execution
----------------

After the playbook has been executed, navigate to the ``omnia_config_credentials.yml`` input file is present in the ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default`` folder.
Provide all required credentials for the cluster. See the table below to know more:

.. note:: By default, the ``omnia_config_credentials.yml`` input file is encrypted. Use the below command to decrypt the file: ::
    
    ansible-vault view omnia_config_credentials.yml --vault-password-file .omnia_config_credentials_key
