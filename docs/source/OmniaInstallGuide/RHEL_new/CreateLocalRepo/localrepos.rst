Configuring specific local repositories
-----------------------------------------

**AMD GPU ROCm**

    To install ROCm, do the following:

        * Include the following line under ``softwares`` in ``software_config.json``:

            ::

                {"name": "amdgpu", "version": "6.3.1"},

        * Add the following line below the ``softwares`` section:

            ::

                "amdgpu": [
                                {"name": "rocm", "version": "6.3.1" }
                          ]

        * A sample format is available `here. <InputParameters.html>`_

.. note:: If ``amdgpu`` group and ``rocm`` subgroup is provided, the AMD GPU drivers are installed during the cluster provisioning process and the AMD ROCm software stack is installed during ``omnia.yml`` playbook execution.

**CUDA**

    To install CUDA, include the following line under ``softwares`` in ``software_config.json``: ::

            {"name": "cuda", "version": "12.8.0"},

    For a list of repositories (and their types) configured for CUDA, view the ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/config/<cluster_os_type>/<cluster_os_version>/cuda.json`` file. To customize your CUDA installation, update the ``url`` parameter with your desired CUDA version URL. URLs for different versions can be found `here <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_. ::

        {
          "cuda": {
            "cluster": [
              { "package": "cuda",
                "type": "iso",
                "url": "https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.8.0/local_installers/cuda-repo-rhel9-12-8-local-12.8.0_570.86.10-1.x86_64.rpm",
                "path": ""
              },
              { "package": "dkms",

                "repo_name": "epel"
              }
            ]
          }
        }

.. note::
    * If the package version is customized, ensure that the same ``version`` value is also updated in the ``software_config.json``.
    * If the target cluster runs on RHEL, ensure that the "dkms" package is also included in ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/config/<cluster_os_type>/9.x/cuda.json``, as shown above.

**OFED**

    To install OFED, include the following line under ``softwares`` in ``software_config.json``: ::

    For a list of repositories (and their types) configured for OFED, view the ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/config/<cluster_os_type>/<cluster_os_version>/ofed.json`` file. To customize your OFED installation, update the ``url`` parameter with your desired OFED version URL. ::

        {
          "ofed": {
            "cluster": [
              { "package": "ofed",
                "type": "iso",
                "url": "https://content.mellanox.com/ofed/MLNX_OFED-24.10-3.2.5.0/MLNX_OFED_LINUX-24.10-3.2.5.0-rhel9.6-x86_64.iso",
                "path": ""
              }
            ]
          }
        }
