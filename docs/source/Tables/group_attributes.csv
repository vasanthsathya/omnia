Name of the cluster- ``cluster_name``,Conditional mandatory,"* Name of the cluster to which the group belongs to. 
* ``cluster_name`` attribute is mandatory for Kubernetes related roles. For non-Kubernetes roles, this field will remain empty.
* This input is case-sensitive. Do not add any special characters except ``_`` (underscore) for the cluster name."
Location of the node - ``location_id``,Mandatory,"* Scalable unit and rack number range.
* Range for ``<n>`` is 0-99.
* **Format**: ``SU-<n>.RACK-<n>``

 **Example**: ``SU-1.RACK-1``

.. note:: This attribute is case-sensitive. Ensure to use uppercase characters only."
Resource Manager - ``resource_mgr_id``,Conditional mandatory,"* This attribute contains the service tag of the active Kubernetes and slurm head node(s).

BMC (iDRAC) static IP - ``static_range``,Conditional mandatory,"* This attribute contains the BMC (iDRAC) static IP range.
* Provide this attribute value only if BMC discovery mechanism is used while provisioning the nodes.
* BMC static range for each group should be mutually exclusive. For example, if ``grp0`` is defined with ``10.5.0.1-10.5.0.10`` of an BMC static IP range, any other group should not contain any IP from that range.

 **Example**: ``10.5.0.1-10.5.0.200``"
Switch IP - ``ip``,Conditional mandatory,"* This attribute contains the IP address of the switch connected to the rack.
* If you want switch-based provisioning, BMC ``static range`` should also be provided and all IPs within the bmc static range should be reachable from the OIM admin NIC. This is to ensure a mandatory `LOM setup <../../Overview/NetworkTopologies/lom.html>`_.
* If 2 groups have the same switch ip, the switch ports must be different (mutually exclusive)."
