  Failed to load images from the tar file {{ failed_images }}.
  Image tar file may be corrupt. To save a new image tar file, remove existing tar:
    cd /opt/omnia/images && \
    rm -f {{ failed_img_tarballs | join(' ') }}

  and then execute the utility below:

    ansible-playbook {{ playbook_dir }}/../utils/save_container_images.yml -v \
      -e 'container_images=[{{ failed_images | map('to_json') | join(',') }}]'

  After saving the images, re-run the telemetry playbook.
